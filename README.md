# Math Stuff

## FractionQuiz

I made a quick app for my son to check his math homework, where he had to compare two fractions (greater than, equal, or less than).

This is my first Tkinter GUI, so it looks a bit rough, but for checking homework, it is good enough. Sometimes that is all you need in software. :-)

## Probability/head or tails

I gave an a very basic talk to 3d graders about Probability, where we did an exercise of flipping a coin, and trying to predict what would be the average number of heads. This notebook demonstrates to them the power of computing and simulating more coin flips than what we could manually do.
